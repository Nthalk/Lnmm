Lnmm (Linux, Node, Memcache, Mysql)
===================================
Lnmm is a implementation of a webstack much like LAMP (Linux, apache, mysql, php)
However it replaces apache and php with node and javascript.

Todo
-----------------------------------
Write a lnmm script that can install itself into the user's .node_libararies,
and can preloads the library path to a script executable. 

Installation and setup
-----------------------------------
Currently there is no installation other than making sure that you have the
dependencies (and their dependencies) installed in the correct places.
